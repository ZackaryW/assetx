# Progress Status

## What Works ‚úÖ
- **Configuration System**: `Config.load()`/`Config.save()` with builtin type validation
- **Generator System**: Four builtin generators with registry for extension
- **Asset Discovery**: File system scanning with generator-based validation (`canHandle`)
- **UID Generation**: Hash-based unique identifiers with collision resolution
- **Lock File Management**: Serialization with metadata and collision detection
- **Code Generation Pipeline**: Complete Dart code generation using generator registry

## What's Partially Built üîÑ  
- **AssetXService**: Has good asset discovery logic but focuses on wrong output (lock files instead of code generation)
- **Models**: `ConfigEntry` and `FileConfig` are solid but may need adjustment for code generation needs

## What's Missing ‚ùå
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tool (`bin/assetx.dart`) with add/remove/sync/gen commands
- **Path Collision Detection**: Logic to prevent overlapping folder configurations
- **Command Validation**: Argument parsing and validation for CLI commands
- **Integration with update_ignore.dart**: Hook for gitignore management

## Current State Assessment
The foundation is solid but needs a **fundamental pivot** from lock file generation to code generation. The asset discovery logic is valuable and can be reused, but the output processing needs complete restructuring.

## Next Implementation Phase
1. Create `AssetGenerator` class for Dart code generation
2. Implement Dart code template system  
3. Add naming convention utilities (file/directory names ‚Üí Dart identifiers)
4. Create CLI interface (no build_runner dependency)
5. Refactor `AssetXService` to use generator instead of lock files
6. Test with example project assets

## Known Issues
- Lock file approach is not the main goal
- Need to understand exact desired generated code structure
- Configuration may need tweaks for generation-specific needs

## Success Criteria for CLI Phase
- `assetx add` command validates types and detects path conflicts
- `assetx remove` command safely removes configurations
- `assetx sync` updates lock files and triggers ignore file management
- `assetx gen` produces complete `asset.x.dart` files from lock data
- CLI provides helpful error messages and validation feedback
- Commands integrate seamlessly with existing AssetXService functionality
