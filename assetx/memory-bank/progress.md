# Progress Status

## What Works ✅
- **Complete CLI Interface**: `bin/assetx.dart` with all four commands (add/remove/sync/gen) fully implemented
- **Configuration System**: `Config.load()`/`Config.save()` with builtin type validation and path conflict detection
- **Generator System**: Four builtin generators with registry for extension
- **Asset Discovery**: File system scanning with generator-based validation (`canHandle`)
- **UID Generation**: SHA256-based unique identifiers with collision resolution
- **Lock File Management**: Serialization with metadata and collision detection
- **Code Generation Pipeline**: Complete Dart code generation using generator registry
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Path normalization for Windows/Unix compatibility
- **Identifier Generation**: Centralized utility for valid Dart identifier creation
- **Ignore File Management**: Integration with update_ignore.dart for gitignore automation

## What's Recently Improved 🔄  
- **Code Organization**: Refactored duplicate `_createValidIdentifier` methods into centralized `IdentifierUtils` class
- **Generated Code Quality**: Fixed Windows path formats, invalid Dart identifiers, and proper camelCase naming
- **AssetXService**: Complete integration with generator registry for production-ready code generation
- **🎉 MAJOR: Fixed Generator Delegation**: CodeGenerationService now properly delegates to generators instead of manual reimplementation
- **Enhanced BaseGenerator**: Added FileAccessor class and generateAccessors() method for structured delegation
- **Type-Safe Accessors**: All generated accessors now have correct types (Image, Map, Future) instead of generic types
- **Complete Asset Support**: Fixed missing constants and type errors across all 4 builtin asset types
- **🎉 NEW: Automatic Pubspec Integration**: Soft assets automatically added to pubspec.yaml during generation
- **🎉 NEW: Package-Aware Asset Paths**: All generated paths use `packages/{packageName}/` format for cross-package loading
- **Utility Architecture**: Clean separation with `PackagePathUtils` for package path generation

## What's Completed ✅
- **Generator Delegation Architecture**: CodeGenerationService properly delegates to generators
- **Direct asset.x.dart Generation**: Complete implementation working with AssetX extensions
- **Extension-Based Integration**: Extensions on `AssetX` class provide clean API
- **Root Folder Class Generation**: All folder structures properly generated with `$files` and `$paths` classes
- **Automatic Pubspec Integration**: Soft assets automatically declared in pubspec.yaml during generation
- **Package-Aware Asset Paths**: All generated paths use Flutter package format for cross-package compatibility
- **Complete Flutter Ecosystem Integration**: Generated code works seamlessly when package used as dependency

## What's Missing ❌
- **Build System Integration**: Optional build_runner support for future enhancement

## Current State Assessment
AssetX has evolved into a **production-ready asset code generation tool** with complete CLI functionality. The system successfully generates Dart code from asset files with proper type safety and cross-platform compatibility.

## Recent Implementation Achievements
1. ✅ Complete CLI interface with all four commands
2. ✅ Production-ready Dart code generation with proper identifier handling
3. ✅ Cross-platform path normalization
4. ✅ Centralized utility organization with `IdentifierUtils` class
5. ✅ Generator registry system with proper extension support
6. ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation
7. ✅ **MAJOR: Proper Generator Delegation** - Fixed architectural issue where CodeGenerationService was manually reimplementing generator functionality
8. ✅ **Enhanced BaseGenerator Interface** - Added FileAccessor class and generateAccessors() for structured code generation
9. ✅ **Type-Safe Generated Code** - All accessors now have correct types instead of generic fallbacks
10. ✅ **Complete Asset Type Support** - All 4 builtin types work correctly with proper constants and accessors
11. ✅ **Automatic Pubspec Integration** - Soft assets automatically added to pubspec.yaml with `requiresPubspecAsset` property
12. ✅ **Package-Aware Asset Paths** - All generated paths use `packages/{packageName}/` format via `PackagePathUtils`
13. ✅ **Cross-Package Compatibility** - Generated code works correctly when used as external dependency
14. ✅ **Clean Utility Architecture** - Proper separation of concerns with dedicated utility files

## Current State
AssetX is now **architecturally complete** with proper generator delegation:
1. ✅ **Direct Generation**: Simplified `asset.x.dart` generation working perfectly
2. ✅ **Extension Pattern**: Proper extensions on `AssetX` class with root folder instances  
3. ✅ **AssetXF Integration**: Leveraging the `AssetX` class from `assetxf.dart` package as base
4. ✅ **Generator Architecture**: Proper delegation to generator system instead of manual reimplementation
5. ✅ **Type Safety**: All generated accessors have correct, specific types

## Success Criteria Achieved ✅
- ✅ `assetx add` command validates types and detects path conflicts
- ✅ `assetx remove` command safely removes configurations
- ✅ `assetx sync` updates lock files and triggers ignore file management
- ✅ `assetx gen` produces complete `asset.x.dart` files with proper formatting
- ✅ CLI provides helpful error messages and validation feedback
- ✅ Commands integrate seamlessly with AssetXService functionality
- ✅ Generated code works across Windows and Unix platforms
- ✅ All asset getter names use valid Dart identifiers
